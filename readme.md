# QZONE FGD PROJECT
An attempt to create an FGD entity definition file for Qzone, a quake expansion sold in the 90s by the now defunct WizardWorks Group, Inc. This expansion adds new enemies and weapon replacements to the original Quake. I'm working on this project so that modders can create maps for the mod, and to make it easier for the entities unique to Qzone to be used in other mods.

## TO DO:
### ☐ Add new enemies to [qzone.md](qzone.md):
☐ flyer

☐ headless

☐ nuker

☐ nukermad

☐ plane

☐ snapper


### ☐ Make sure the nailgun replacement (slicer) works correctly
### ☐ Bugtest
