This is a work_around for the QZone.qc.
Remind I had to clip out some info.
Mostly the org_x is a float, not a vector.
For this reason it is not the original Qzone progs.dat.
It is only for testing purpose.
If you like you can use the original qc I extracted.
This will not confirm a new progs.dat, only the errors there were.
